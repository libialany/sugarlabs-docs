# Orange JAMath Activity

JAMath is a math problems with addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Click the answer choices that show the results in ascending order.

I was inspired and I decided to create my own version OrangeJAMath by implementing and modifying. I believe this type of game is good to start. It's important to note that I used existing code for educational purposes to learn game development concepts.
